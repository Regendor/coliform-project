#Usage
##Imports
The following imports are used:
```python
from Coliform import OneWire, Pump, ArduCAM, MultiPlot, Heater
from Coliform import GUI
```
The first is for all functions, but the GUI, and the second is to import the GUI function.
##OneWire
###Setup
These group of functions allow you to detect one or multiple OneWires, get their address and display their respective temperature. This code was written and tested for [DS18B20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18B20.html/tb_tab0) OneWires.

If multiple OneWires are connected, they need to be in the following configuration:
![OneWire Connection](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/99c16972ad946ec3d40c29d4999fdc90600728ac/68747470733a2f2f7570726d7265736561726368726573746f2e66696c65732e776f726470726573732e636f6d2f323031362f30392f6f6e657769726572706973657475702e706e673f773d34383326683d363431)

Where black, is ground, red is power (3.3V), and yellow is the digital signal. You also need a 4.7kÎ© resistor connected as shown. All yellow (signal) cables send their signal to the GPIO4 pin of the RPi.

In order to detect OneWires, using the w1-gpio kernel driver, the GPIO4 pin has to be setup to recieve the information from them, in order to do this open the RPi terminal and do the following:

* Type: ```sudo nado /boot/config.txt```
* Add: ```dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=4``` to the end of the file.
* Press: ```Ctrl + X``` followed by ```y``` and ```ENTER``` or ```RETURN```
* After this, type: ```sudo reboot``` and wait for RPi to reboot, for changes to be applied.

###Code
In order to get OneWire address, use the following function:
```python
from Coliform import OneWire

ids = OneWire.getOneWireID()
```
Where the values stored in ```ids``` will be a list with the addresses of the OneWires connected, for 2 OneWires:
```python
['/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-000005e2fdc3','/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000482b243']
```
These addresses change for each OneWire device.

In order to get temperature values the following code can be used:
```python
from Coliform import OneWire

TemperatureStringValues, TemperatureRawNumbers = OneWire.getTempList()
```
Where the first value, ```TemperatureStringValues``` is a string in the following format, for 3 OneWires:
```python
'21.312 C\n32.321 C\n43.232 C'
```
Which is displayed as:
```
   21.312 C
   32.321 C
   43.232 C
```
The second value ```TemperatureRawNumbers``` gives a list of temperature numbers, for 3 OneWires:
```python
['21.312','32.321','43.232']
```
##MultiPlot

##ArduCAM
```python
   from Coliform Import ArduCAM
   path = /home/
   filename = 'Test.jpg'
   portid = ArduCAM.getSerialPort()
   ArduCAM.TakePicture(path, portid[0], filename)
```

##RPiCamera
These functions use [picamera](https://github.com/waveform80/picamera), 
for more information on how to use the Camera and addtional usage, visit picamera [documentation](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.12/).

Here is a sample code to take a picture and show image taken. Current resolution is 1024 x 1008
```python
from Coliform import RPiCamera

# Takes picture after a 2 sec delay, and returns array to rgb_array variable
rgb_array = RPiCamera.takePicture()

# Show image taken
RPiCamera.showImage(rgb_array)


```

Now, to display an image with only green values in low light environment, we use:
```python
from Coliform import RPi.Camera

# Takes picture after a 30 sec delay, and returns array to rgb_array variable
# The following parameters are set: ISO(300), shutter speed(6 seconds), framerate(1/6), set exposure to off.
rgb_array_lowlight = RPiCamera.takePictureLow()

# Display only set color for the image, color choices are, for red: 'r' or 'red', green: 'g' or 'green', and blue: 'b' or 'blue'
# This requires an rgb image array, which is provided from the picture taken above and stored in rgb_array_lowlight
g_array = RPiCamera.setImageColor(rgb_array_lowlight, 'g')

# Displays image provided by the green rgb array. A 'greensacle' image
RPiCamera.showImage(g_array)

```

In order to get intensity values from the previous example, the following can be used:
```python
# Continuing from previous example
# Returns green intensity average value between range 0-256
green_intensity_avg = RPiCamera.returnIntensity(rgb_array_lowlight, 'g')

# Returns red intensity average value for the same range as described above
red_intensity_avg = RPiCamera.returnIntensity(rgb_array_lowlight, 'r')

# Returns blue intensity average value for the same range as described above
blue_intensity_avg = RPiCamera.returnIntensity(rgb_array_lowlight, 'b')

# Returns overall "Brightness" intensity value, for the same range as described above
overall_intensity_avg = RPiCamera.returnIntensity(rgb_array_lowlight, 'intensity')

# Or if we want to get all rgb and overall intensity values at the same time:
red_avg, green_avg, blue_avg, intensity_avg = RPiCamera.returnIntensity(rgb_array_lowlight)

# If we only want to get all rgb values at the same time:
red_avg, green_avg, blue_avg = RPiCamera.returnIntensity(rgb_array_lowlight, 'rgb')
```

In order to display plots containing histograms of red, green, blue raw data, along with redscale, greenscale, and bluescale images, we use the following:
```python
# Continuing from low light example
# Shows histograms and colorscaled images
RPiCamera.showPlot(rgb_array_lowlight)

```
```python
if RPiCamera.detectCamera():
    print('Camera is found')
else:
    print('Camera not found')
```

For further image processing, consider using [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) and [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) python libraries, for image manipulation as described here: [Advanced image processing using scipy and numpy](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/advanced/image_processing/)

##RPiGPIO
Both RPiGPIO use GPIO.PWM class from [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO). 
This is done in order to use software PWM to control pumps and Heaters.

In order to start the PWM control, and use it, the following code can be used:
```python
from Coliform import RPiGPIO
pin = 11 #RPi pin
frequency = 100 #start frequency

# Initialize the PWM controller
PWM = RPiGPIO.Controller(pin, frequency)

#Start PWM controller
PWM.startup()

#Start HeaterPID
PWM.HeaterPID()

freq = 50 # new frequency value
#change frequency within range
PWM.setIntensity(freq)

#Stop PWM
PWM.shutdown()
```

##GUI
In order to display the project GUI, the following code can be used:
```python
from Coliform import GUI

GUI.startGUI()
```
The GUI displayed should look like this:

![GUI](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fec1ad443d25d345045462c50a307343fc3ff7a8/68747470733a2f2f7570726d7265736561726368726573746f2e66696c65732e776f726470726573732e636f6d2f323031362f30392f67756975706c6f616465642e706e673f773d373438)
